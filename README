Hawk is a lightweight log analyzer which was designed to be fast and efficient.

It scans log files on the fly and bans IP that makes too many password failures. 
It adds iptables rules to reject the IP addresses. 
You can define the logfiles.

What makes Hawk better then the other solutions out there is its unique Web Interface and its flexibility.

Hawk currently supports:
  sshd
  dovecot
  courier
  pure-ftpd
  proftpd
  cPanel
  DirectAdmin
