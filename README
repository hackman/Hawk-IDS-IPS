Hawk is a lightweight log analyzer which was designed to be fast and efficient.

It scans log files on the fly and bans IP that makes too many password failures. 
It adds iptables rules to reject the IP addresses. 
You can define the logfiles.

What makes Hawk better then the other solutions out there is its unique Web Interface and its flexibility.

Hawk currently supports:
  sshd
  dovecot
  courier
  pure-ftpd
  proftpd
  cPanel
  DirectAdmin
  Postfix
  Exim with dovecot auth


Installation CentOS:
1. rpm -Uvh hawk-7.2-1.src.rpm
2. Setup iptables or ipset
2.1. For ipset, create a new ipset and add its name in /etc/hawk/hawk.conf on the ipset_name line.
2.2. For iptables, you can either create the chain by your self and set its name in hawk.conf or you can use /usr/share/hawk/setup_iptables.sh helper script, to do that for you.
3. systemctl start hawk
